# What's this?

A small project developed as an entry test for a job I applied for shortly after finishing a web dev masterclass

## Additional info

Case of use:  
A person attends an event for which he already signed up.  
He uses a small app which allows you to exchange your email with other participants.  
The exchange takes place via QR code, so the attendants each have a badge with a QR code on it.  
They scan each other's badge with the afore mentioned app and thus exchange emails.  

Requirements:  
DB for user data and record of the exchanges.  
API calls for authentication and email exchange.  
Basic HTML, CSS, JS for the UI and its interaction with the API. It is possible to use and ID code in a form instead the QR code.
